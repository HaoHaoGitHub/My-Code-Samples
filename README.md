# My-code-Samples

I am currently a graduate student in the Information Technology major (concentration in Software Design and Engineering) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and plan to graduate with a Master of Science in December 2016. I consider myself as a highly capable Software Engineer. Complementing my diverse skill set, I have developed an excellent understanding of a wide range of programming languages and tools. I am a self-starter and excel at analysis, design, and documentation. Additionally, I am deeply familiar with Agile/ Scrum methodology and adapt quickly to new procedures. I am also a Computer Science graduate teaching assistant for two courses: Operating Systems and Principle of Software, in which I provide help for over 100 students in each course. 

Thank you!
