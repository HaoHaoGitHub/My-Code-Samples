# My-code-Samples

My name is Hao (Henry) Chen, Candidate of MS Information Technology & Web Science and 
graduate of MS Quantitative Finance and Risk Analytics in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 

My primary programming language is C/C++. I also am familiar with Linux Bash and windows command 
prompt. Besides, I am good at a couple of database languages including MySQL, PL/SQL, JDBC, MongoDB.
And my understanding of data structure and algorithm qualifies me as a software developer.

This depository contains my codes in school and some are from personal interests like coding competitions,
interviews etc. 

Thank you!
